# Image Restoration using Denoising Autoencoders

*To design and implement a denoising autoencoder capable of restoring images corrupted by various types of noise.*


Dataset: Utilize a standard image dataset like MNIST.

Data Augmentation: Introduce various types of artificial noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, speckle noise) to the clean images to create a noisy dataset.

Application: Develop a simple web or mobile application where users can upload noisy images and get the denoised version in return.
